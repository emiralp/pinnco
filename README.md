# Streamlined AI Context

Transform your codebase into an optimized AI-friendly format. Seamlessly integrate your entire project context with AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT.

## Why We Built This?

When working with AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT, I found myself constantly struggling with code sharing. Without using specialized IDEs, I had to either upload files separately or manually merge them. This tool magically transforms your project into AI-pastable content in seconds, and it's completely FREE! (Excluding node_modules and cache files for optimal performance)
