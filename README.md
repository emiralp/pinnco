# Streamlined AI Context (SAC)

[Try it online at Pinn.co!](https://pinn.co)

Transform your codebase into an optimized AI-friendly format. Seamlessly integrate your entire project context with AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT.

## Why We Built This?

When working with AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT, I found myself constantly struggling with code sharing. Without using specialized IDEs, I had to either upload files separately or manually merge them. This tool magically transforms your project into AI-pastable content in seconds, and it's completely FREE! (Excluding node_modules and cache files for optimal performance)

## Features

### ðŸ”„ Multiple Input Methods
- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag your project files or folders directly into the interface
- **GitHub Integration**: Fetch repositories directly using URLs, with support for private repositories via Personal Access Tokens
- **Auto-Save**: Your GitHub credentials are securely saved locally for quick access

### âš¡ Smart Processing
- **Token Management**: Control output size with configurable token limits
- **Code Processing Options**:
  - Remove comments for cleaner context
  - Minify code to maximize token efficiency
- **Selective Processing**:
  - Customizable file type filtering
  - Exclude patterns for ignoring specific files/directories
  - Smart default exclusions (node_modules, cache files, etc.)

### ðŸ”’ Security First
- **100% Local Processing**: All file processing happens in your browser
- **No Server Storage**: Your code never leaves your machine
- **Secure Credentials**: GitHub tokens are stored locally and securely

### ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Features
- **Format Preservation**: Maintains code structure and readability
- **Smart Filtering**: Automatically excludes binary and unnecessary files
- **Size Management**: Handles large codebases with automatic chunking
